# Timer
A simple timer created for the purpose of streaming on twitch. It is made with python 2.7.X.

This is a RAW timer for people who just want to keep track of their run times (for example, when playing games like Kaizo Mario World).

It is straightforward easy to use and to run it you just have to run
```
python timer_window.py
```

This will be changed in the future.
